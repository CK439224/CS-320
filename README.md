How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I make
sure I focus on the requirements from the client and ensure that they are met.
I also code to the standards set forth by the company I am employed by to ensure
that I am meeting the companies standards for secure code. 


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

In order to interpret the user need, we need to conduct user interview where we
can create/design user wants and needs in order to create useful user stories.
With these Items, I can design my code to encompass the needs and wants of the final user.


How do I approach designing software?

My approach to designing software, I begin by analyzing the requirements set
forth in the project requirements. Once I review the requirements, I break down
what needs to be completed into smaller sections so I can develop code in smaller
chunks. This allows me to test each section as I complete it. These smaller chunks
consist of the basic code for that section and I go back later and add more detail
to sections that require it
